#  PashuVision - Cattle & Buffalo Breed Classifier

## 📌 Overview
PashuVision is a **Machine Learning-based Breed Classification System** for identifying different breeds of cattle and buffaloes.  
It uses deep learning models to classify breeds from images, helping in livestock management and digital record-keeping.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload cattle/buffalo images for **breed prediction**
- Pre-trained ML/DL model for classification
- Image preprocessing pipeline for consistent results
- Easy deployment on **Google Colab** or **local system**
- Ready for integration with **Streamlit App** or **FastAPI API**
